Comp Sci 303

NEW UPDATED PROGRAM WITH EXCEPTION HANDLING ON BOTH FUNCTIONS.

Program Instructions:

1. Program runs and asks the user if they are a Professional or Non-Professional Employee. 

2. User then inputs 1 or 0 depending on what they are.

3. If user is a Pro, program will ask for name and how many years they have worked for the company. Program will then output their monthly salary, the amount of money that went towards their health contributions and the amount of weeks they have for vacation this year.

4. If user is a Non-Pro, program will ask for name and how many hours  they have worked for this week. Program will then output their weekly salary, the amount of money that went towards their health contributions and the amount of hours they have earned for vacation this year during that week.

5. Both Pro and Non Pro are derived from the Class Employee and the data members are Protected so they can be accessed within both child classes.
