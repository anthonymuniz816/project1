Program Instructions:

Ask user for the quantity of numbers in the file, user must input the total amount and must input a number.

Once that is done, the program will read through the file and add every number into one big array.

Program then displays the options the user can do with the program and asks the user for input, user must input one of the selected characters in the option menu.

If the user inputs “a”, the program will then ask the user to input the number they are looking for. If the number is in the array it will output the index of the number the user was looking for but if it is not in the array it will output that the number is not in the array.

The program will then output the array to show the user how it looks and will ask for another option.

If the user inputs “b”, the program will then ask for the index of the number the user wants to modify and its replacement. 

The program will then output the array to show the user how it looks and will ask for another option.

If the user inputs “c”, the program will then ask the user for the number they want to add to the array.

The program will then output the array to show the user how it looks and will ask for another option.

If the user inputs “d”, the program will then ask the user for the index of the number they want to delete from the array.

The program will then output the array to show the user how it looks and will ask for another option.
